## Project Overview

Strong passwords are the cornerstone of cybersecurity. This desktop GUI tool measures password strength dynamically as you type and verifies if your password has appeared in known breach databases, empowering users to create safer passwords effortlessly.

Built with Python and PyQt5, it bridges backend security logic with polished front-end user experience, making it a practical beginner-to-intermediate project that combines theory with real-world application.
